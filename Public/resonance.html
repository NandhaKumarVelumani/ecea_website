                How well can you speak the language of the machines? Is it well
                enough to make them listen to you? Or great enough to make them
                think for themselves and turn against us? Either way, make a bot
                of your own to follow a line track for two trial rounds and one
                final round as the lines end up getting more complex. Remember,
                it's a game of margins in this field day for budding Robotics
                enthusiasts. But as we've seen in the movies, with every great
                trick comes a final reveal. So get ready to be quizzed about the
                workings and the algorithm of the magic that you weave on stage.
                So get in line, inventors.

                There is no use in being an introvert. Tired of being an
                introvert? What about playing an act, the act of being an
                extrovert, that too for just 30 mins. Knowing a stranger better
                is what the competition demands from the competitors. Who will
                tend to remember things about a stranger? This competition is
                all about knowing a stranger within the given time limit. “To
                know and to be known”, is the theme of this competition. Speed
                networking helps you to be an extrovert and being an extrovert
                is cool. So just get ready to know someone and also don't be shy
                to let someone know you.
